# Quintin Kanji Paint Project
This is a program where the user can paint a kanji and all of its strokes and test themselves on it.

A year ago, I made this as a final project for a programming class, and I begun this repository where I left it off.

Now I added save study sets so that the user can study the same kanji later.
