# Quintin Kanji Paint Project
This is a program where the user can paint a kanji and all of it's strokes and test themselves on it.

A year ago, I made this as a final project for a programming class, and I begun this repository where I left it off.

Now I would like to add the feature for the user to save study sets so that they can study the same kanji later.
