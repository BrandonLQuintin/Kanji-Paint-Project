INFO
------------

Wanted a kanji study program on your computer?
Wanted to take notes on kanji?

This program can help you!

FEATURES
----------
1. Draw Kanji and test yourself on each stroke order!
2. Save a photo of the Kanji you drew!
3. Save a Kanji (along with a picture) so that you can review it later!

Try it out!
-------------
1. Click "Open Kanji Sets
2. Go to the included folder "Kanji"
3. Select everything with "CTRL + A"
4. Click Open!

This is a program where the user can paint a kanji and all of its strokes and test themselves on it.

A year ago, I made this as a final project for a programming class, and I begun this repository where I left it off (So that I can make another final project with it)!

Now I added save study sets so that the user can study the same kanji later.
